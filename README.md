# Deep Learning 5 Course Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. 

## My thoughts

As a CS student my goal is to always keep learning.
With time I got interested in the Deep Learning world and decided to dive in.
I have found a rich world with endless possibilities, and thanks to Adnrew Ng and his colleagues I'm sure I acquire my knowledge from the best in the field.
